## LEARNING PATH 1: Get started with artificial intelligence (AI-900) 

### [Get started with artificial intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence-on-azure/)

### What is AI?

AI - Software that imitatates human behavior and capabilities

- Machine Learning
- Anomaly Detection
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge Mining

### Understand machine learning

Use massive amount of data for training machine learning models that can predict future outcomes

Machine learning in Microsoft Azure

- Automated Machine learning
- Azure Machine learning designer
- Data and compute management
- Pipelines

### Understanding anomaly detection

Analyses data overtime and detect unusual changes 

- Anomaly Detection service API

### Understand computer vision

AI dealing with Visual Processing

Common Computer Vision tasks,

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Semantic Segmentation
- Image Analysis
- Face Detection
- OCR - Optical Character Recognition

Computer Vision in Microsoft Azure

- Computer Vision
- Custom Vision
- Face
- Form Recognition

### Understand natural language processing

AI dealing with undesrtanding written and spoken language

Natural language processing (NLP) in Microsoft Azure

- Language
- Translator
- Speech
- Azure Bot

### Understand knowledge mining

Extracting information from large amount of unstructured data

Knowledge mining in Microsoft Azure

- Azure Cognitive Search

### Challenges and risks with AI

- Bias results
- Errors causing harm
- Data exposure 
- Not compatible for everyone
- User's need to trust complexity
- Liability issues for decisions

### Understand Responsible AI

- Fairness - not biased for anyone
- Reliability and safety
- Privacy and Security 
- Inclusiveness - must empower everyone
- Transparency - user's should be aware
- Accountability - governance structure

## LEARNING PATH 2: Explore visual tools for machine learning (AI-900) 

### [Use Automated Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/use-automated-machine-learning/)

### Machine Learning

Uses mathematics and statistics to create a model that can predict future unknown values

Supervised machine learning approach

- Regression: predict a continuous value
- Classification: determine a binary class label

Unsupervised machine learning approach

- Clustering: used to determine labels by grouping similar information into label groups

### Azure Machine Learning studio

Train and deploy effective with a lot of simplicity and automation

You must create Workspace in your Azure subscription first

Computer Resources you can create,

- Computer Instances
- Computer Clusters
- Inference Clusters
- Attached Compute

Azure Automated Machine Learning

- Automated machine learning capability that automatically tries multiple pre-processing techniques and model-training algorithms in parallel
